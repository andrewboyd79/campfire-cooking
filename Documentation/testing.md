# **Code Validators**
Code validators were used on all .html and .css pages to ensure the code used, in the P-L Services website, was valid.

## [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)


Code was validated through Direct Input by copying and pasting the html content directly in to the validator:

index.html

- No errors or warnings to show on index.html

# Bugs
The following bugs were noted during development of the Craft Gins NI website:
- issues getting dropdown function to operate correctly initially - issue due to incorrectly formatted JQuery - resolved by amending JQuery syntax following research
- issues getting markers to display on Google Maps initially - only single marker would display - resolved by amendeing javascript code and separating lat/lng variables within the producersinfo.js file
- issues getting sendEmail to operate correctly - test email from within sendMail worked but not on form submission - form labels/names/id needed set correctly using information set in documentation
- producers.js appeneded elements incorectly - elements were not being appended to correct divs - used template literals to create content and remove need for extensive appending
