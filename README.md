# **Campfire Cooking Website** 
![Logo](LINK TO PROJECT LOGO)

[View website](LINK TO GITHUB PAGES OR HEROKU)

This Campfire Cooking website has been produced by Andrew Boyd as a Milestone 3 Project for the Code Institute’s Full Stack Web Development course.

After over a year of restrictions on travel and exploration, due to Covid-19, many people are seeking a chance to get back out in to the great outdoors for activity and recreation. For many, nights will be spent sitting, relaxing, swapping stories round a campfire with some food and drinks. Others will be happy to stay at home and enjoy time with family, friends and neighbours sharing a bite to eat and drink around a firepit or open BBQ.

The Campfire Cooking website aims to enable those individuals to find and share recipes, from around the world, that can be used to create dishes on an open fire. 
Users will get a list of ingredients needed, along with a method to follow; the site aims to give users an indication of how long it will take to prepare and cook the dishes and suggest how difficult the recipe is. 
Similar dishes will be grouped together to allow users to create meals and search functionality aims to help them find recipes quickly. 
As the website relies on contributions from its users it aims to make the process of adding, editing and removing recipes simple and intuitive, but also give the site administrators suitable functionality to maintain and develop the site over time.

# **UX**
User Experience, and associated UX design, is concerned with how a user interacts with something; throughout this project, consideration has been given to each of the five planes of UX.

## Business Goals
The business expects this website to:
- Provide recipes suitable for campfire cooking
- Inspire and generate an interest in cooking on an open fire
- Increase brand awareness and widen its target audience. Imagery, colours, fonts and logo which are associated with the Campfire Cooking brand will be used throughout the site.
- Showcase Campfire Cooking products and direct users toward those products e.g. campfire cooking pots/utensils
- Connect fans with the Canpfire Cooking social media channels

## Target audience
The target audience of this website is:
- Individuals who regularly enjoy the outdoors/wilderness
- Campers/glampers
- Families looking for a new way to cook
    
Users will be expecting information presentation to be:
- Clear – the recipes need to be well laid out and easy to follow
- Engaging – the website should take users on a journey of discovery into new way of cooking and new flavours
- Intuitive - additing/editing recipes needs to simple process
- Appealing

Users will be comfortable with the following types of content:
- Imagery – of food, how it was cooked and products used to cook it
- Text – should be informative and concise 
- Videos
- Interactive elements

## User Goals
Users of this website expect to be able to:
- Be inspired by the recipes provided by Campfire Cooking
- Find recipes, metting their individual needs/tastes, that can be cooked on a campfire
- Add and edit their own recipes to the Campfire Cooking site
- Rely on Campfire Cooking recipes to create simple/tasty food
- Find out tips/techniques on how to cook on a campfire from other users/outdoor experts
- Find useful products for campfire cooking


## User Stories
The following user stories have been developed to outline some of the benefits the website has to its users:

1. As a user I want to find campfire recipes so that I can cook meals on an open fire

2. As a user I want to be able to add my own recipes so that others can enjoy them

3. As a user I want to be able to edit my recipes so that I can update/amend details after I've submitted them

4. As a user I want to be able to delete my recipes so that I'm in control of my recipe

5. As a user I want to find out best practices for campfire cooking so that I can improve my cookery

6. As a user I want to be able to search for recipes so I can quickly find the information I'm looking for

7. As a business owner I want to be able to inform individuals about my products and services so that I can sell Montserrat

8. As a business owner I want to be able to generate increased brand awareness so that my brand becomes synonymous with open fire cooking

9. As a site administrator I want to be able to maintain the user recipe ssection so I can maintain the quality of the recipes submitted

10. As a site administrator I want to get information on which recipes and products are popular so I can create future content which appeals to the user


## User considerations
Consideration has been given to the following when developing a website which meets the needs of both the business and the users:

- There are many different websites which provide recipes/cooking resources for all types of cooking; a number of other websites cover wild camping, however very few provide recipes for campfire cooking
- There are other successful examples of good recipe/cooking websites driving individuals towards a specific product (even in a crowded marketplace) e.g. Weber BBQs have very successful website & cookbooks which support their BBQ products ranges

## Design Considerations

### Colours
![Colours](LINK TO COLOURS SWATCH) 

These have been selected to give a clean minimal look to the website and to tie in with the material design colour palette, as provided by Materialize.  
 - blue-grey (#607d8b)
 - blue grey darken-2 (#455a64)
 - blue-grey lighten-4 (#CFD8DC)
 - orange (#ff9800)
 - white (#ffffff)
 - grey darken-4 (#212121)
 - grey darken-1 (#757575)
 - grey lighten-1 (#BDBDBD)

The combination has been checked on Adobe Colour; no potential conflicts have been found and the swatches are colour blind safe.

### Fonts

- The versatile sans-serif font family Acumin Pro has been chosen for use throughout the website at font weights 400 & 700. It performs well at display sizes and weights but also is clear and readable at lower text sizes. It is available on Adobe fonts and if it fails it will be replaced with a sans serif font within the browser.

### Icons
The following Material Design icons will be used throughout this website:
- [ICON DESCRIPTION]( INSERT REFERENCE) 

The icons will always use the "filled" theme.

# **Features**
The website will initially be developed as a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and developed from there with new features being added as time/developer skills allow.

## Initial release features
Based on importance/feasability analysis the following features will be available in the initial release:

- INSERT INITIAL RELEASE FEATURES

## Global Features
The following features will persist across all website pages to provide a consistent look and feel:
 
 - Header section
    - Logo - the logo (.png file) will be located in the center of the header; it will provide consistent branding.  Clicking on the logo returns the user to the home page.
    - Navbar - the user registration/login elements will be located to the right hand side of the navbar and will only be displayed if no user has logged in to the website. Once the user has logged in the logout element will sit on the right hand side of the logo with the other navigation elements sitting to the left hand side. Active page elements will be accented to distinguish them from the other navigation links.
    - Side navigation bar - on smaller screen sizes a side navigation bar will be present under a hamburger menu button and will contain the same navigation link options as the top navbar on larger screen sizes.
    - The header will size responsively.

- Footer Section
    - The footer will include social media and further navigation links.
    - The footer elements will resize responsively with elements being displayed in columns on larger screen sizes and in rows on smaller sized screens.
